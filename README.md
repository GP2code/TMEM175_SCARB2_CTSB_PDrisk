# TMEM175, SCARB2 and CTSB associations with Parkinson's disease risk across populations

# Summary

This is the online repository for the manuscript titled "TMEM175, SCARB2 and CTSB associations with Parkinson's disease risk across populations". This study focuses on exploring the role of lysosomal related genes(TMEM175, SCARB2, CTSB and GBA1) in existing PD/control datasets from the AMP-PD and GP2 Neurobooster genotyping array.

# Data statement
All GP2 data is hosted in collaboration with the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and is available via application on the website (https://amp-pd.org/register-for-amp-pd). For up-to-date information on GP2 data acquisition, access, and policies, visit https://gp2.org/. 
All data was using release 8 GP2 data and AMP-PD release 4.
